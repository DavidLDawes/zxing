<h2 id="title">Welcome to the KochZap App</h2>
<h3 id="tagline"><b><i>We help keep the Koch Brothers out of your wallet!</i></b></h3>
<p>Our simple app has 2 ways to help identify products from Koch Industries or made from one of their brands.</p>
<ol><li><b>Handy logo reference to identify Koch brands/logos</b></li>
    <li><b>Scan a product UPC label to check for Koch Industries company codes</b></li></ol>
<p> Most of the time simply checking the brand/logo reference can steer you away from their products.
    You can always use the scanning function to verify an individual product is not from a Koch Industries company.
    You will quickly learn which products to avoid in your lifestyle, and then only need to use the Koch Zap app for an occasional reminder.</p>
<ol>
    <li><p><b>Identify Koch Brand Logos</b> - The lower or right-hand portion of the KZ app displays a scrollable image composed of many Koch Industries product and brand logos to avoid.</p>
        <img class="imghalf" src="../images/screenshot.png"/>
        <p>Simply refer to this list when shopping and avoid these Koch brand name products and products made using Koch branded materials.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Scan a Product</b> - You can use the KZ app scan function to read a typical product UPC label.</p>
    <img class="imghalf" src="../images/big-1d.png" width="100"/>
    <p>To initiate a product scan simply press the KochZap button at the top or left of the screen.</p>
    <img class="imghalf" src="../images/main.png"/>
    <p>The first time the scanning function is used it will require allowing the use of your camera.  Once in the scanning mode
    you will see a scan widow in which to center the product UPC code.</p>

    <p>You can use your <i>Volume Up/Down</i> buttons to switch the camera light on/off, which can help in low light settings.
    If the UPC company code for the product scanned is not associated with Koch Industries you will get the <i>Thumbs Up</i> response.</p>

    <p>You will get the <i>Thumbs Down</i> response when the UPC code registers as a Koch Industries related company.</p>

    </li>
</ol>
<p>Given the dynamic nature of Koch Industries businesses, the KochZap app can't guarantee accuracy in determining Koch products, though we try tp do our best to keep up with changes.
    A large percentage of Koch Industries sales are to other companies, providing materials for products sold by those companies, hence a scan will not show a Koch relationship.
    That is why it is important to become familiar with Koch brand logos, like Dacron and Stainmaster, so as to avoid products made from them.</p>
